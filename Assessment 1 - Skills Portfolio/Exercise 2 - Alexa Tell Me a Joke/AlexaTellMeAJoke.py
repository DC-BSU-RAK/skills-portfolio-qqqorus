# Exercise 2 - Alexa tell me a Joke

The randomJokes.txt file in the resources folder contains a dataset of random jokes. 
Each joke is on a new line and consists of a setup and punchline separated by a question mark. 
For example:

    - Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the other side.
    - What happens if you boil a clown? You get a laughing stock.
  
Develop a Tkinter GUI application that acts like a joke-telling assistant. 
The program should:

- Display a window with a button labeled "Alexa tell me a Joke".
- When the button is clicked, randomly select a joke from the randomJokes.txt file, 
    display the setup of the joke in a label.
- Provide another button labeled "Show Punchline"- When clicked, 
    display the punchline below the setup.
- Include a "Next Joke" button so the user can request another random joke.
- Additionally , provide a "Quit" button to close the application.
